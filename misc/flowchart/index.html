<h2><a name="BeginBattle">BeginBattle</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Left-click and drag a box to select all combatants</li>
  <li>Right-click on one combatant and toggle combat state</li>
  <li>Switch to the combat tab</li>
  <li>Click "Roll All" to determine combat order.  Those with highest basic speed go first [BX363].  In the case of a tie, the character with the highest DX can go first [BX363].  If there is still a tie, GM can choose (GURPS game aid uses 1d6).</li>
  <li>Click "Begin Combat" (at the bottom)</li>
</ol>
<p class="style1"></p>

<h2><a name="Maneuvers">Maneuvers</a></h2>
<p class="style1">Once the battle begins, the active combatant will be highlighted in the combat tab.  For each combatant, choose one of the maneuvers listed here and follow the steps listed.  Once each maneuver is complete, click the right-arrow at the bottom of the the combat tab to highlight the next combatant.</p>

<p class="style1">Note: Each combatant has a Set Maneuver button with a select-list of maneuver icons that can be toggled.  It would be great to use these to keep track of which maneuver was chosen for each combatant.  Unfortunately, every time I try to set one, then end up getting de-selected once I click on another combatant.  So, it is not very useful.  Perhaps this is a bug, or perhaps I am not using it correctly.</p>

<h3><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-nothing.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /><a name="DoNothing">Do Nothing</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is the only maneuver available to a combatant that is <a href="#Stun"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-stunned.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Stunned</a>, <a href="#MentalStun"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-stunned-iq.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Mentally Stunned</a>, or surprised.</li>
  <li>The combatant may attempt an HT roll to recover from <a href="#Stun"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-stunned.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Stun</a> or an IQ roll to recover from <a href="#MentalStun"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-stunned-iq.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Mental Stun</a>.  On success, the combatant recovers on the end of this turn [BX364].</li>
  <li>No movement is allowed with this maneuver [BX364].</li>
  <li>Any active defense is allowed.  Remember to included penalites for <a href="#Stun"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-stunned.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Stun</a>, <i>etc</i>. [BX364]</li>
  <li>All combatants are treated as if they took this maneuver before they take their first turn.</li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-move.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /><a name="Move">Move</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The maneuver assumes that the combatant is moving and taking no other actions (other than free actions).</li>
  <li>The combatant may move any number of yards/hexes up to the current value in the Move column with the yellow highlight and indicated with the characters ">>" in the left-most column of the Encumberance, Move & Dodge table of the character sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-change-posture.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /><a name="ChangePosture">Change Posture</a></h3>
<p class="style1">One full turn may be used to change posture.  This is normally done to recover from being knocked down or make one's self a smaller target for ranged attack.  Different rules apply to which posture can be chosen, based on the current posture.  See each posture in the list below for details.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Postures">Standing (default posture)</a>
  <li><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/path-condition-prone.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /><a href="#PostureLyingProne">Lying Down / Lying Prone</a></li>

<h3><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-aim.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /><a name="Aim">Aim</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Specify the target and the weapon that is being aimed.</li>
  <li>If 1 full turn is spent aiming, then add weapn accuracy to bucket when performing the next attack.  Do this by clicking on the red button in the Acc column of the ranged weapons table in the character sheet [BX364].</li>
  <li>If 2 or 3 turns are spent aiming, then add an additional +1 or +2 to bucket when performing the next attack [BX364].</li>
  <li>If targeting systems are used (sights, targeting computers, etc.) those bonuses may be added to the bucket.  The total from all of these systems cannot exceed the weapon accuracy [BX364].</li>
  <li>If the weapon is braced, then add an additional +1 to bucket when performing the next attack [BX364].</li>
  <li>If any other maneuver is chosen before the next attack, then the aiming bonus is lost.</li>
  <li>The combatant may make a step movement and retain the aiming bonus <i>unless</i> the weapon is a braced, two-handed weapon [BX364].</li>
  <li>If any active defense is used, then the aiming bonus is lost [BX364].</li>
  <li>If any injury is received, a successful Will roll must be made, or the aiming bonus is lost [BX364].</li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-evaluate.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /><a name="Evaluate">Evaluate</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>This maneuver is the melee equivalent of the <a href="#Aim"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-aim.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Aim</a> maneuver.</li>
  <li>Specify one visible target to be evaluated.</li>
  <li>For each full turn spent evaluating, add a bonus of +1 to the bucket when performing the next attack [BX364].</li>
  <li>If any other maneuver is chosen before the next attack, then the evaluate bonus is lost.</li>
  <li>The combatant may make a step movement and retain the evaluate bonus.</li>
  <li>The comnatant may use any active defense and retain the evaluate bonus.</li>  
</ul>

<h3><a name="Attack"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-attack.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Attack</a></h3>

        <ol>
          <li>If Fast-Draw Skill [B194] exists, click on RSL button in Character Sheet and check chat window for result.  On success, proceed with attack.</li>
          <li>On failure or if no Fast-Draw Skill exists, spend this turn executing <a href="#Ready"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-ready.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Ready maneuver</a> and attack next turn.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Select the combatant and open the modifier bucket dialog.  Click on all buttons in the "Current Effects" section that are related to the attack skill to add those modifiers to the bucket.   This includes your posture and conditions such as <a href="#Shock"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/condition-shock1.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Shock</a>, provided that the attack skill is IQ or DX-based.</li>
      <li>If the attacker is using the <a href="#AllOutAttackDetermined"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-aoa-determined.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />All-Out Attack (determined)</a> maneuver, then add a bonus to the bucket of +4 (melee) or +1 (ranged).</li>
      <li>If melee attack and <a href="#Evaluate"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-evaluate.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Evaluate</a> maneuver was chosen on previous turns
        <ol>
          <li>If choosing new target, discard evaluate modifier</li>
          <li>Otherwise, click on bucket and add recorded evaluate modifier</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If ranged attack
        <ol>
          <li>If <a href="#Aim"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-aim.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Aim</a> maneuver was chosen on previous turns
            <ol>

              <li>Otherwise, click on bucket and add recorded aiming modifier</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Add range modifier to bucket: Ctrl-click-drag a line to the target, then click on target.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If targeting a specific part of the body, the apply the penalty from the table in [BX552] to the bucket.  This may be done by selecting the location in the Hit Locations section of the Modifier Bucket dialog, though this dialog also includes locations from [MA137] that are not included in [BX552].  Note that locations with note [1] in the table (<i>i.e.</i> eye, skull, face, groin, neck, and vitals) will hit the torso if they miss by 1.</li> 
      <li>Perform the attack.  Click on Level button in Weapon table in Character Sheet and check chat window for result.</li>
      <li>If attack is successful, move to next step.  Otherwise, turn ends.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Check if defense is successful</b>
    <ol>
      <li>No active defense is possible if the defender is unaware of the attack, unconscious, immobilized, executed an <a href="#AllOutAttack"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-allout-attack.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />All-Out Attack</a> maneuver, or is otherwise unable to react [BX374].  In this case, assume defense fails and move to next step (calculate damage).</li>
      <li>Unless the defender has Peripheral Vision [B74] or 360&deg; Vision [B34], assume that the defender is unaware of an attack from behind and that no defense is possible.  The exception is a runaround attack [BX391] in which an attacker runs from the defender's front to its back.  In this case, proceed with the active defense and add a penalty of -2 to the bucket.</li>
      <li>Select the combatant and open the modifier bucket dialog.  Click on all buttons in the "Current Effects" section that are related to active defenses to add those modifiers to the bucket.   This includes your posture and conditions such as <a href="#Stun"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-stunned.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Stun</a>, but not conditions that affect DX only, such as <a href="#Shock"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/condition-shock1.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Shock</a>.</li>
      <li>If defender's last maneuver was All-Out Defense (increased defense for <a href="#AllOutDefenseBlock"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-def-block.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />block</a>, <a href="#AllOutDefenseParry"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-def-parry.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /> parry</a>, or <a href="#AllOutDefenseDodge"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-def-dodge.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /> dodge)</a> [BX366], and defending with the method chosen at the time of the maneuver, then apply the bonus to the bucket (may do this when defending against every attack this turn).</li>
      <li>If the attacker made a successful <a href="#Feint"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-feint.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Feint</a> on the previous turn or a successful <a href="#AllOutAttackFeint"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-aoa-feint.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />All-Out Attack (feint)</a> on this turn, then add the bonus to the bucket.</li>
      <li>If blocking
        <ol>
          <li>Any ready object (shield, cloak, or other large object, including another character) may be used to block [BX375].  If object is not ready, defender cannot use this defense and must spend a turn executing <a href="#Ready"><img src="images/gameaid/maneuvers/man-ready.png" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Ready maneuver</a> to use this defense on future turns.</li>
          <li>You can block any melee attack, thrown weapon, projected liquid, or muscle-powered missile weapon. You cannot block bullets or beam weapons (too fast) [BX375].</li>
          <li>click on Block button in Melee Weapon table in Character sheet and check chat window for result</li>

      </li>
      <li>If parrying
        <ol>
          <li>The defender can parry melee attacks or thrown weapons.  Other ranged weapons can be parried only if the attacker is within reach of the defender's melee weapon [BX376].
            <ul>
              <li>Thrown weapons larger than 1 <i>lb.</i> (<i>e.g.</i> spears) are parried with a -1 penalty [BX376] (add this to the bucket)</li>
              <li>Thrown weapons smaller than 1 <i>lb.</i> (<i>e.g.</i> knives, shuriken) are parried with a -2 penalty [BX376] (add this to the bucket)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Each successive parry this turn carries a cumulative penalty (add this to the bucket):
            <ul>
              <li>-4 Normally</li>
              <li>-2 with either the <i>Trained by a Master [B93]</i> or <i>Weapon Master [B99]</i> advantage</li>
              <li>-1 with both of these advantages</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>click on Parry button in Melee Weapon table in Character sheet and check chat window for result</li>
          <li>If an unarmed attack was successfully parried, the defender gets a free attack on the attacker.  Immediately roll for attack (-4 penalty if attacker used <i>Judo or Karate [B203]</i>) and damage.  There is no defense. [BX376]</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If dodging
        <ol>
          <li>Dodge may be used to defend against any attack [BX374]</li>

You should see the Reeling label in the Hit Points table of the combatant's character sheet, but no modifiers will be applied (and it will not pulse) unless you toggle the status indicator.</li>
          <li>If HP is reduced to 0 or less, the combatant must make a HT roll at the start of its next turn (at -1 per full multiple of base HP below 0) [BX419].  On failure, the combatant is <a href="#Unconscious"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-unconscious.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Unconscious</a>.  This roll must be made successfully on every turn to remain conscious.</li>
          <li>If HP is reduced to -1&times;HP or less, the combatant must make an immediate HT roll or die[BX419].  This roll must be made again each time an injury is received that reduces HP to another multiple of base HP (<i>i.e.</i> -2&times;HP, -3&times;HP, and -4&times;HP) [BX419].

  <li>If the feinter's roll fails, the feint fails.</li>
  <li>If the feinter's roll succeeds, but the defender's roll succeeds by <i>as much or more</i>, then the feint fails.</li>
  <li>If the feinter's roll succeeds, but the defender's roll fails, and if the feinter attacks the defender on its next turn, then the defender must apply the margin of success as a penalty on active defense rolls for those attacks.
    <ul>
      <li><i>e.g.</i> feinter's effective skill is 15 and the roll is 12 (success by 3)</li>
      <li>defender defends with a -3 penalty on feinter's next turn [BX365]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the feinter's roll succeeds, but the defender's roll succeeds by <i>less</i>, then subtract the feinter's margin of victory from the defender's defense.

      <li><i>e.g.</i> feinter's effective skill is 15 and the roll is 10 (success by 5)</li>

  <li>Allies cannot take advantage of a feint.  The defender's penalty applies only to the feinter's next attack turn.</li>

  <li>If the feinter cannot attack the defender on the next turn, the advantage is lost.</li>
  <li>After attacking with a shield, a combatant may also feint with the shield [BX365].</li>
  <li>A step movement is allowed.</li>
  <li>Any active defense is allowed.  However, if a combatant feints and then parries with an unbalanced weapon, it cannot attack on its next turn, rendering the feint useless.</li>

  <li>Once a combatant has been reduced to 1/3 of their original FP, the combatant is fatigued / tired [BX426].</li>
  <li>Effects
    <ul>
      <li>Move is halved (round up)</li>
      <li>Dodge is halved (round up)</li>
      <li>ST is halved (round up)</li>
      <li>ST-based quantaties such as HP and damage are not affected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The GURPS Combat Assistant will automatically show whether or not a combatant is tired in the Fatigue Points table of the character sheet, but it will not automatically apply the effects.</li>
  <li>To apply the effect, toggle the <img src="images/gameaid/statuses/path-condition-exhausted.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Fatigued status indicator on the token.  You will notice that the move and dodge are reduced.  You will also notice that the tired indicator in the Fatigue Points table starts to pulse.</li>
  <li>If FP is reduced to 0 or less, the combatant is on the verge of collapse [BX426].
    <ul>
      <li>Each further FP lost also results in the loss of 1 HP.</li>
      <li>Combatant must make a successful Will roll to do any maneuver other than Do Nothing.</li>
      <li>On a failed Will roll, the combatant collapses and must Do Nothing until FP becomes positive.</li>
      <li>On a critical-failre, the combatant must also make a successful HT roll to avoid a heart-attack [BX429].</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If FP is reduced to -1&times;FP (the minimum possible FP), the combatant is <a href="#Unconscious"><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-unconscious.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 />Unconscious</a> until FP becomes positive.  Any further FP injury will apply as HP injury [BX426].</li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="images/gameaid/statuses/dd-condition-unconscious.webp" width=20 height=20 hspace=5 /><a name="Unconscious">Unconscious / Disabled</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>No actions may be taken while unconscious [BX423].</li>
  <li>With HP > 0, combatant wakes up 15 minutes after falling unconscious [BX423].</li>
  <li>With 0 &ge; HP > -1&times;HP, combatant makes an HT roll to awaken every hour [BX423].</li>
  <li>With HP &le; -1&times;HP, combatant makes a single HT roll to awaken in 12 hours [BX423].</li>

<h3><a name="StrikeWeapon">Striking at Weapons</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>First, state whether the intent is to <a href="Disarm">Disarm</a> or <a href="BreakWeapon">Break the Weapon</a> [BX400].</li>
  <li>If <a href="Disarm">Disarming</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Only a weapon that can parry may be used to disarm (<i>i.e.</i> only unarmed attacks, melee weapons, and some thrown weapons may be used to disarm) [BX401].  See the Parry column in the Melee Weapon Table [B271].</li>
      <li>Increase the attack penalty by -2, <i>unless</i> the weapon being used is a fencing weapon (<i>i.e.</i> main-gauche, jitte/sai, rapier, saber, or smallsword) [BX401]. Look for "F" in the Parry column of the Melee Weapon Table [B271].  Remember that main-gauche and jitte/sai are not weapons <i>per se</i> but rather skills that can be used with certian weapons [B208].</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Striking a weapon, whether to disarm or break the weapon, incurs an attack penalty depending on the weapon's reach.  The position of the attacker also depends on the weapon's reach. [BX400]
    <ul>
      <li>Defenders' weapons with reach "C" incur a -5 penalty, and the attacker's weapon must reach the defender's hex.</li>
      <li>Defenders' weapons with reach 1 incur a -4 penalty, and the attacker's weapon must reach to the defender's hex or the hex directly in front of the defender.</li>
      <li>Defenders' weapons with reach 2 or greater incur a -3 penalty, and the attacker's weapon must reach the defender's hex or any of a number of hexes directly in front of the defender equal to the defender's weapon's reach. 
        <ul>
          <li><i>Exception:</i> A combatant may always attack a reach 2+ weapon that was used to attack the combatant on the previous turn</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Defending when a weapon is attacked
    <ul>
      <li>a defemder may Dodge or Parry with the attacked weapon</li>
      <li>a defender may not Block or Parry with a different weapon</li>
      <li>the defense bonus of a shield is ignored</li>
      <li>a defender may combine a dodge or parry with a retreat</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Disarm">Disarming</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Once successful attack has been made against a weapon <i>and</i> any defense has failed, the attacker may disarm [BX401]</li>
  <li>To disarm, roll a Quick Contest [BX348] of weapon skills [BX401]. 
    <ul>
      <li>In general, the attacker rolls against their skill with the weapon being used to disarm, and the defender rolls against their skill with the targeted weapon.</li>
      <li>If a missile weapon is targeted, roll against DX instead.</li>
      <li>Either the attacker or defender may make a ST-based skill roll instead, if that would be better.</li>
      <li>Add a +2 modifier if a Jitte/Sai or Whip skill is used.</li>
      <li>The defender gets a +2 modifier if a 2-handed weapon is used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each combatant rolls against their effective skill.  The winner is the one with the largest margin of success (or smallest margin of failure) [BX 348].  Note that the attacker's effective skill does <i>not</i> include the modifiers added when rolling to <a href="#StrikeWeapon">Strike the Weapon</a> [<a href="https://thecollaborativegamer.wordpress.com/2016/01/14/thursday-is-gurpsday-gurps-melee-academy-disarming/">ref</a>].</li>
  <li>If the attacker's margin is larger than the defender's margin, the weapon flies 1 yard in a random direction [BX401].</li>
  <li>If there is a tie, or the defender's margin is greater by 1 or 2, then he keeps the weapon, but it is unready.</li>
  <li>If the defender's margin is greater by 3 or more, then he keeps the weapon, and it remains ready.</li>
  <li>If the attacker rolls a critical failure, then the attacker is disarmed.</li>

</ul> 

<h4><a name="BreakWeapon">Breaking a Weapon</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Once successful attack has been made against a weapon <i>and</i> any defense has failed, the attacker may damage the weapon targeted [BX401]</li>
  <li>To find a weapon's HP, see the Object Hit Points Table [BX558].  Find the weight in the Weapon Table [B271] and use the Homogeneous/Diffuse column, in general.  <i>e.g.</i> clubs, maces, broadswords, and rapiers have (3 lbs.) HP 12, while sabers and smallswords (2 lbs.) have HP 10.</li>
  <li>Determine the weapon's damage reduction (DR) [BX483].
    <ul>
      <li>Solid wooden weapons (<i>e.g.</i> clubs) have DR 2.</li>
      <li>Small metal or metal-wood weapons (<i>e.g.</i> guns, axes) have DR 4.</li>
      <li>Solid metal weapons have DR 6.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Weapons in good repair are assumed to have HT 12.  Modifiers of +2 to -3 may be applied for especially strong or poorly made weapons [BX483].</li>
  <li>Roll damage normally and apply the damage to the weapon [BX483].
    <ul>
      <li>If HP is reduced to 0 or less, the weapon must make a HT roll each turn to avoid breaking.  The weapon can still be repaired, later.</li>
      <li>If HP is reduced to -1&times;HP or less, the weapon must make a HT roll to avoid being destroyed completely and cannot be repaired.  This roll must be made again each time damage is received that reduces HP to another multiple of base HP (<i>i.e.</i> -2&times;HP, -3&times;HP, and -4&times;HP).</li>
      <li>If HP is reduced to -5&times;HP or less, the weapon is destroyed immediately.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
