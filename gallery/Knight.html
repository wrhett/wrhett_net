<p align="center" class="style1">This was a fun project to make some
art-work for my sons' bedroom.  We put up seveal of wall decals from
e-glue.fr in the "Knights vs. Dragons" theme and wanted a bed-spread
to go with them.  This knight was drawn in a similar style.  This
image was created in Inkscape as an SVG, so that it could be exported
for an image that was 4.5 feet tall.</p>
