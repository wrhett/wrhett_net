<p align="center" class="style1">Twilight Tone (1997)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This image was the program and poster
art for the Halloween 1997 <a
href="http://caljazzchoir.berkeley.edu">Cal Jazz Choir</a> concert
<i>The Twilight Tone</i>, named after the <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>
song, which was the lead number.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The members that inspired each
caricature are (with recent name changes in parentheses, when I could
find them) from left, front row: Ken Carlile, Helen Pogrel, Alyson
Cabrera, Kevin Lam, Sarah Aldinger, Corbi Wright, Susan Garcia
(Martin), myself, back row: Michelle Bloom (Goetzl), Jessica Reeder,
Malcom Darrell, Prakash Bhave, and Sara Ferejohn (LaBatt).  Anyone who
knows these fine performers will recognize that I didn't do them
justice.  My most egregious errors were makeing Helen too short and
Alyson too tall, and then placing them next to each other.  But boy,
this sure was fun to draw, and much more fun to perform with them.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">I love to draw, but I have shied away
from portraits.  Every portrait that I have ever drawn, including
these tiny little caricatures, captured something that I deeply loved
about the person being drawn.  Showing the portrait is a little like
telling someone that you love them, and hearing that they don't like
it is like being told that they don't love you back.  But that's not
an excuse for keeping them hidden.  I'd like this and the three other
caricatures & silhouettes that I drew of the Cal Jazz Choir to be a
big "I love you" to all the members.  You guys rock!</p>
