<p align="center" class="style1">Sax Magic (1998)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This image was the program and poster
art for the spring 1998 <a href="http://caljazzchoir.berkeley.edu">Cal
Jazz Choir</a> concert. It was the last of the four images that I drew
of the Jazz Choir, and my memory of it is bitter-sweet, since my time
with them was coming to an end.  Fortunately, I have had the joy of
singing occasionally with many of them and other great artists in the
years since.  The members that inspired each caricature are (with
recent name changes in parentheses, when I could find them) from left,
front row: Helen Pogrel, Alyson Cabrera, Albert Choi, Corbi Wright,
Kevin Lam, back row: Jessica Reeder, Ken Carlile, Malcom Darrell, me,
Susan Garcia (Martin), Michelle Bloom (Goetzl), and Sarah
Aldinger.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The saxophonist was none other than
Dan "the Sax Man" Schlessinger, who used to play in the wee hours of
the night in the alley-ways of the Cal Berkeley campus (yet one more
person who helped me to fall in love with my school).  I was thrilled
that he agreed to pose for the photo.  I had originally promised him
that he wouldn't appear in the final version, since I had planned to
create a CG saxophone, as I did earlier with the piano (see Jazz Piano
1996).  But the burden of constructive solid geometry proved too much
for me, and instead I turned to photoshop to block-out Dan's face,
lest he become the central focus of the image.  Sorry, Dan!</p>
