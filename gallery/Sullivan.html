<p align="center" class="style1">Does that Train Seem a Little Loud to You? (1991)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This was the T-shirt design for
Sullivan Residence Hall at NCSU in 1991, my sophomore year.  We
gradually got used to having trains go by our windows at 2am as we
were trying to sleep, but it wasn't easy.  This image was originally
created as ink on paper with amberlith overlays for red brick and gray
highlights.  I colorized it using Photoshop in 2009 for my dear friend
Rick Beyer, who used it as the cover art for his most excellent rock
retrospective compilation titled <i>Der Mixen CD Die Suiten 901 Der
Niff-Nerf</i>.  Thanks to all of my 901 Sullivan suite-mates and
friends for making it such a great couple of years!</p>
