<p align="center" class="style1">When I was a boy, I couldn't get
enough of these plastic bricks.  I used to dream that I had a magical
factory that could make as many of them in as many colors as I wanted.
Now it seems that the wonders of computer graphics have given me just
that.  I find that what I enjoy most is shrinking myself down to the
size of the tiny figures and inhabiting their world for a moment.  I
still like the idea of making huge scenes, but it turns out that
there's a lot more to good story-telling than simply having the right
bricks.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This scene was modeled in Blender and
rendered with Yafaray.  The faces and torsos were designed in Adobe
Illustrator and touched-up using Photoshop on a Lenovo Tablet.  This
was my first project using Yafaray, and after making this image, I was
hooked.  The quality is expensive, though.  This image took 24 hours
to render (extra time for a high-resolution render, to reduce
grainyness), compared to less than one second for Trains (2009) using
the Blender internal renderer.</p>
