<p align="center" class="style1">As a kid, I spent too much time being
jealous of people who were more popular than me.  We were alike
in so many ways, but for some reason I judged them as being bad people.
Now I feel sad that I missed the opportunity to get to know them better.
I made this short story to communicate some of that lesson to my boys.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">After the complexity of Trains (2009)
and Bricks and Toys (2011), I felt the need to try some simple
story-telling.  This project took only 2 weeks from start to finish.
It was originally created as an interactive Shockwave file in Adobe
Flash with Action Script for navigation.  The frames were drawn with a
Lenovo tablet directly into Flash.  The 3D graphics were modeled and
rendered with Blender and imported into Flash as PNG images.
Unfortunately, it was finished at about the same time that Adobe
dropped support for Mobile Flash, which seriously limited the
convenience of distribution.  I made this animated GIF with Camtasia
to give some flavor of the finished product.</p>
