<p align="center" class="style1">This image was used as advertising
art for an <a href="http://www.artistsinresonance.com/"><i>Artists in
Resonance</i></a> concert.  I'm very fond of this image, but it is
unfortunately one of those ideas that I think is brilliant, but no one
else seems to get.  The idea was that we were holy angels making silly
but beautiful music, trying to pull people away from their evil
television sets and into our concert hall on a Saturday night.
Obvious, right?  Oh, well.  I guess it's good that I went into
engineering, instead of communications.</p>
