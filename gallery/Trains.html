<p align="center" class="style1">This scene was designed and rendered
with Blender.  The blocks and trains were modeled after my 2-year-old
son's favorite toys, which we enjoyed for many many hours together.
The train textures were desiged in Microsoft Visio.  The sky
background image comes from
<a href="http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=24038">M@dcow</a>,
and the grass image for the ground comes from
<a href="http://sketchuptut.com/grass-texture-sketchup-warehouse-type009">
Sketchuptut.com</a>.
Finally, the beautiful wood texture came from a tutorial that I have
unfortunately lost.  If you recognize it, please let me know!</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This was my second big project using
Blender.  Since then, I've learned some important tricks, such as how
to get flat and smooth surfaces on the same object.  This project also
helped me to learn the even more important KISS principle (Keep It
Simple, Stupid!), which is a must for every aspiring artist.</p>
