<p align="center" class="style1">Chinese characters are works of art in
and of themselves.  If we are to admire that beauty, then perhaps it
is best with a beautiful word.  The character <i>ai</i> is generally
translated as "love" in English.  In Chinese translations of the
<i>Bible</i>, this character is used in place of the Greek word
<i>agape</i>, the highest form of love, as in 1 Corinthians 13:13,
"...and the greatest of these is love."  The model for this image was
designed using Blender and rendered with Yafaray.  The basic form of
the character was traced from the stroke-order animation found on
mdbg.net. </p>
