<p align="center" class="style1">Arthur Kunstlinger (2008)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">Arthur Kunstlinger is the main
character in a story that I made up for my boys.  He stumbles upon a
door to another world while playing hooky and finds a nutty professor
who starts teaching him how to create his own worlds with this amazing
magical clay-like material called <i>artifice</i>.  The professor
tells him that there is an entire civilization spanning many worlds
created by a society of artisans called the <i>Worldsmiths</i> and that
he hopes Arthur will become a Wolrdsmith himself one day.  But Arthur
grows impatient and runs away to find the Worldsmiths for himself.
Once he's out on his own, he learns that he knows just enough to
get himself into some big trouble.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">You only really learn how to use a
new application once you create your first big project, and Arthur was
my first big project in <i>Blender</i>. With him, I learned how to
mesh, rig, skin, shade, and animate characters, and I also created the
first world in the <i>Blender</i> game engine.  The character shown
here took me eight months to create, measured from when I drew the
first sketch to when I was finally crushed under the complexity of the
project. Zachary was only a year old at the time, and Benjamin wasn't
even born, yet.  At the time, I imagined that I would be able to
animate some scenes before they were old enough to understand the
story, but this is the only finished image that ever came out of the
project.  I finally started telling them the story this year (2016),
and it has been great fun.  I peruse the old project files
occasionally to inspire me to keep going with the story.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">Much of the reason why Arthur's story
and <i>Blender</i> continue to hold my interest came from my
experiences playing <i>World of Warcraft</i> and <i>Second Life</i>
before my sons were born.  So many people invest so much of their
lives in these online realities, now, and the hunger for new material
never seems to end.  I wanted to see how the sausage was made, so to
speak, since the chips that I make are helping (in very small part) to
keep these worlds going.  Is there any redemption in these worlds, or
are they simply time-wasters?</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">Arthur was made in <i>Blender</i>,
with textures adapted in <i>Photoshop</i> from pictures that I found
on the web.  The jeans are <i>Levi's 505</i>, the boots are 1958 army
combat boots that I found at <a href = "http://www.classicboots.com"
>classicboots.com</a>, and I have no idea where the jacket comes from,
because it's sold by 11 different online retailers, each of which give
it no trademark other than their own.  I rendered this image using
<i>Yafaray</i> in 2016 so that I could have something to show for all
my effort!</p>
