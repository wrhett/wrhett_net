<p align="center" class="style1">I am an engineer, and I can do
anything!  Wait!  Not that kind of engineer!  This happy guy has been
my best effort in character design so far.  I was looking to create
scenes of characters to mix with the trains motif (see Trains 2009).
I was also looking for a style that was simpler than one explored with
Arthur Kunstlinger (2008) that could be expanded to
larger scenes more easily.  It did end up being simpler, but still
took me 5 months to finish!  Aye, aye, aye.  This stuff takes a long
time!  Still, this is a pretty good compromise, and if I ever do start
making scenes with more characters, it will probably follow the same
approach used with this little engineer.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This model was created with Blender,
with the texture images created with Adobe Illustrator.  I went back
and rendered this version with Yafaray in 2016, since I like the look
of Yafaray so much.  Rendering the high resolution version took less
than an hour, since it uses direct lighting and a single, large area
light.</p>
