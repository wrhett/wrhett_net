<p align="center" class="style1">Wonders of Engineering (1991)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This image was the cover-art for the
NC State College of Engineering Handbook for the 1991-92 school year
(though I may be off by a year or two).  I really love wrap-around
cover art, and wanted to make one for the handbook.  These handbooks
are a thing of the past, now that we distribute everything through the
web, but I think it's a great idea to get students to liven up the
program with their artwork.  What better way to get people to invest
in their school?  It worked on me.  Because of this and many other
such experiences, I've devoted my career to NCSU.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">I guess that I got into engineering
the same way that everybody does: an infatuation with technology that
won't quit.  This cover is a hodge-podge of some of my favorite techie
<i>paramours</i>, including jets, trains, circuit-boards, exploding
Erlenmayer flasks, skyscrapers, looms, and mecha from Japanese
<i>manga</i>.  At least one thing in this picture is something that I
do at work every day (and it's not the mecha).</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The computer monitor is showing icons
from the NC State Eos system, which was only a couple of years old at
the time this was drawn.  It's a nod to Eric Scott, Ken Barnhouse,
Bobby Pham, Tim Lowman, Marshall Brain, and Bill Willis, all of whom
were instrumental in getting me involved in the early days of Eos as a
software developer and teaching assistant.  Thanks so much to all of
you.</p>
