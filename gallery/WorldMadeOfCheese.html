<p align="center" class="style1">World Made of Cheese (2000)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This image was the cover art for the
<a href="http://www.artistsinresonance.com/"><i>Artists in
Resonance</i></a> album of the same name.  The inspiration came from
the amazing Jennifer Chang, who grew tired of singing
<i>Flashdance... What a Feeling</i> and altered the opening lyrics
during rehearsal one day.  "In a world made of steel, made
of... CHEESE!"  The photo for this image was taken just after
performing in the first round of the <i>International Championship of
Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA)</i>.  We were pretty psyched, and went on
to make it to the semi-final round in our region that year.  The
pictured members are (crouching in front, left to right) Jackie Treu,
Sara Mackie, Judy Ho (Gavazza), and Sarah Aldinger, and (standing, left to
right), Rufus Jones, Jen Alexander (Kiefer), Terry Lee, Joel Slotkin, yours
truly, and Robin Lee.  I cannot begin to say how amazing it was to
sing with this fine group of performers!</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This image was created with a host of
tools: <i>Ray Dream Designer 3D</i> for the rocket, cheese-its and
goldfish, <i>POV Ray</i> for the swiss-cheese ball, <i>Bryce 3D</i> for
the sky, and <i>Photoshop</i> for the compositing.  One of the more
amusing tidbits from this project was that my right and and Robin's
left hand were outside the margin of the photo and therefore missing.
I had to fashion hands for us using ones copied from Joel's right and
Terry's left, respectively.  It's pretty obvious to me, but I don't
know if anyone else would ever notice.  Did you?</p>
