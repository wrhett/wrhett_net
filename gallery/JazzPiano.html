<p align="center" class="style1">Jazz Piano (1996)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This image was the program and poster
art for the fall 1996 <a href="http://caljazzchoir.berkeley.edu">Cal
Jazz Choir</a> concert.  It holds a special place in my heart as a
memory of my first time singing with an <i>a cappella</i> group and
also my first ray-traced image.  It was the first of four images I
would draw of the Jazz Choir all of which are very dear to me, because
of how much I loved them all and cherished the chance to sing with
them.  The members that inspired each silhouette are (with recent name
changes in parentheses, when I could find them) from left to right:
Michelle Bloom (Goetzl), Wynn Wilcox, Sara Ferejohn (LaBatt), Toby
Jaw, Sarah Aldinger, me, Susan Garcia (Martin), Prakash Bhave, and
Corbi Wright.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The piano was created using
constructive-solid geometry (CSG) with the <i>Persistence of
Vision</i> ray-tracer (a.k.a. <i>POV-Ray</i>), which seems amusing and
quaint in retrospect, since quad-meshes dominate 3D graphics
these days.  In contrast, this piano keyboard was created with
hundreds of little cylinders, spheres, and trapezoids, all drawn on
graph-paper and painstakingly entered into POV-Ray source code, one
coordinate at a time.  Even more amusing is the fact that I never
thought to render a version that was more than 780 pixels wide.
Because hey, who would ever possibly need more pixels than that in a
computer graphics image, right?  My, how times have changed.</p>
