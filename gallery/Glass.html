<p align="center" class="style1">This image brings me more peace than
any other that I have created.  When I wake up in the morning and the
cares of the world start to crash in, drinking a glass of water helps
me to stay focused on staying healthy and pure: two important tasks
that are so easy to overlook.  It revives me so much that I feel as if
new life is being poured into me, becoming in me "a spring of water
welling up to eternal life."  Jesus said that God would give the Holy
Spirit to anyone who asks for it.  For many years that made no sense
to me.  But now, I think it does, and for that, I am eternally
grateful.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This is my first image using water
and glass together.  It was modeled with Blender and rendered with
Yafaray.  The pitcher was modeled after a William Yeoward Crystal
design that I love, and the glass is one in our house from Crate and
Barrel.  The objects are broken into meshes depending on each index of
refraction: one for glass, one for water, and one for the glass-water
interface.  Using direct-lighting with the sunsky, this image didn't
take very long to render (about 15 minutes).  The trickiest parts were
debugging the normals and the ray/caustics depth.  A depth of 20 gave
the best quality, and increasing it beyond that made no discernable
difference.</p>
