<p align="center" class="style1">This image was the T-shirt graphic
for the 1990 South Carolina All-State Math Team.  I made it as a
high-school senior, hoping to be on the team myself, but alas!  I
didn't make it.  They did, however, give me a T-shirt and a copy of
<i>Archimedes' Revenge</i> by Paul Hoffman, which I enjoyed immensely
and is a fantastic book for any high-schooler with a budding interest
in math.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">Mathematics has always offered a
beauty and perfection that I find very attractive.  I didn't just want
to use math.  I wanted to fly around it and live in it.  This image
was my first attempt to do that.  In retrospect, it's easy to see from
this image how hungry I was for some kind of 3D graphics software.  It
makes me appreciate the folks who made <i>Blender</i> all the
more.</p>
