<p align="center" class="style1">Journeys in Jazz (1997)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">This image was the program and poster
art for the spring 1997 <a href="http://caljazzchoir.berkeley.edu">Cal
Jazz Choir</a> concert <i>Journeys in Jazz</i>.  It was inspired by
Joseph H. Jennings' delightful arrangement of Bill Evans &
R. W. Worth's song <i>Journey to Recife</i>, as performed by
<i>Chanticleer</i>.  Whenever I listened to it, I could just see the
Jazz Choir grabbing the nearest mode of transportation and heading for
the beach.  I pestered director Bill Ganz until he let us perform it.
Thanks so much, Bill!  Your tireless creativity, loving guidance, and
infinite patience with us were truly a blessing.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The members that inspired each
silhouette are (with recent name changes in parentheses, when I could
find them) from left to right, on plane: Corbi Wright, Michelle Bloom
(Goetzl) and Sara Ferejohn (LaBatt), on flying carpet: Prakash Bhave,
wearing in-line skates: Toby Jaw and Sarah Aldinger, in toy car: Wynn
Wilcox, wearing Hawaiian shirt and sarong: myself and Susan Garcia
(Martin).</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">It was hard posting this and the
other artwork of the Cal Jazz Choir and Artists in Resonance members.
My time with them was so amazing, and it disappeared as quickly as it
appeared.  It's hard not to get nostalgic.  My hope in posting them is
not to inspire nostalgia, but rather to point us in the direction that
I hope we'll all go.  It was a gift, meant to fill us with joy that
overflows into the rest of the world.  Let your light shine!</p>
