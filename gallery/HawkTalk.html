<p align="center" class="style1">Hammond Hawk Talk and Literary Magazines (1990)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">During my senior high-school year at
<a href="https://www.hammondschool.org">Hammond School</a>, I had the
great privilege to share the job of editor-in-chief of the school
newspaper <i>Hawk Talk</i> along with my brilliant friend Thomas
Kennedy. Along the way, I got to work with many other talented writers
and artists.  It is one of my most cherished memories of high-school
and was quite a valuable lesson in humility, too. Thanks to my friends
who put so much effort into making it happen: Thorne Barrett, Kathy
Boozer (Boone), Chad Brasington, Catherine Clark, Trent Gillespie,
Eleanor Green (Schut), Amy Hollis, Alice Howell (Carter), Cameron
Howell, John Kleckley, Kel McClanahan, George Meetze, Ted Mitchell,
Mary Moore (Keever), Nick Papadea, Margaret Ellen Pender, Chapman
Quantz, Leslie Robinson, Anne Sproul, Kerry Stubbs, Chris Walkup,
Shawn Zeller (Gordon), and of course my dear twin brother Richard
Davis.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">Please enjoy all nine issues of the
<i>Hawk Talk</i> for the 1989-1990 school year, linked below. And as a
special bonus, Iâ€™ve also included the two literary magazines published
that same year: <i>Firefly Anthology</i> edited by Cameron Howell and
Thomas Kennedy and <i>CWA</i> edited by Kerry Stubbs and Kel
McClanahan.  These magazines feature many of the <i>Hawk Talk</i>
contributors and many other fine writers and friends not listed
above.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The type-setting quality of these
documents really dates them.  If my memory is correct, the <i>Hawk
Talk</i> was compiled with the old Br&oslash;derbund <i>Print Shop</i>
software on an Apple IIe computer, printed with a dot-matrix printer,
and copied with a mimeograph machine.  We chose that approach, rather
than the traditional 6-column newspaper format, because the previous
year saw only a single issue of the <i>Hawk Talk</i> and no literary
magazines that I remember.  We wanted to focus our efforts on writing
and artistry, rather than the mechanics of getting the newspaper out
the door.  And in that sense, I think that it was a magnificent
success.</p>
