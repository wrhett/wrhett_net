<p align="center" class="style1">Celtic Cross (2015)</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">The Celtic cross continues to
intrigue me as a striking symbol of our brokenness. At once, the cross
declares that our true home is elsewhere, while the sun-circle shows
our unwillingness to let go of this world. It is a reminder to me of
God's mercy as I seek him, keeping me focused on his greatest gift
while graciously letting me indulge in its beauty. The model for this
image was designed using Blender and rendered with Yafaray. It was
inspired by an image of a wall plaque that I found for sale from
pacifictradingonline.com. </p>
